When we make syntax errors, the interpreter will tell us line number and type of error.

Even worse, they might fail silently without any indicator.\n\nIn those cases, we have a \"bug\" in our code and we have to debug it.  \n\nThere are couple ways to debug code. A simple approach would be adding `print()` statements into the code to check if the variable has the expected value at certain step.\n\nAnother way would be using \"variable inspector\" which will print about current status at each step of the code.
